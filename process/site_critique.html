	<h4>Navigation</h4>
	<p>They sectioned off your playlists and liked songs on a side bar and at the top for quick access. Great choice to display the search bar and the home button at the top. Scrolling to the bottom takes you to the extra stuff like their About and Permium Membership</p>
		
	<h4>Usability</h4>
	<p>For desktop, it's more prefered as the larger screen makes everything more accessible. I really like the symbols used for the main functions that are used the most. They are all in front and are labled when hovered over. For the ads, 30 minutes of ad-free listening doesn't seem like a long time, depending on what your listening to, especially with the amount of ads that you have to go through if you don't have premium.</p>
	
	<h4>Typography and hierarchy</h4>
	<p>Going with a sans serif font gives a straighforward look. The text serves more as a lable and this allows for the covers to take control. I like the idea of having tabs for the different categories they offer at the top. They also have your playlists and recently listened to songs up high, which was a great choice, access wise. </p>
	
	<h4>Overall style/look and feel</h4>
	<p>Overall, It's easily understandable how Spotify has done a great job at giving the look of a music straming service. From the logo to the interface, for the most part, everything looks great and is ver accessible. </p>
